Create a single-page client app which does the following:
1) Implements an online form to obtain user interaction data suitable for demonstrating full CRUD activity,

2) Consumes a RESTful API, using jQuery for all API requests,

3) Provides a visualisation that displays the results of the client-server interaction. You should assume that data exchanged between the client and server will be in JSON format. 

4) A server app, developed in PHP, that implements a RESTful API interface, and which services the CRUD requests from your client app. You may utilise a database,
   or local files, to store application data. All server-client data exchange should utilise JSON. 

5) The app should provide the following features:

a) Your RESTful client and service should work with a Reading List database (table, file, etc.). The database contains records with the following fields: ID (automatically generated), Date (creation date), Name (name of item in Reading List), URL (URL link for the reading list resource), and Description (Description of the resource), for example:
 

"reading list item" : {
"ID" : 12345,
"theDate" : "10-04-2017",
"name" : "JSON Examples",
"URL" : "Some nice JSON examples from the official resource json.org
}

b) The "ID" should be automatically generated with the (C)RUD (create) request supplying the other information.

c) "theDate" does not need to be specified as it should be computed automatically.

d) You should provide three update CR(U)D (update) requests, one for each of the remaining data fields ("name", "URL" and "theDesc").

e) You should provide two different C(R)UD (retrieve) request entry points, for example, "ID" and one other.

f) Your CRU(D) (delete) request should delete records based on ID.
 

NOTE: You do not need to perform any kind of authentication for the CRUD activities
